# Problem statement
#Write a function to implement binary search which will take a sorted list and a number. It returns the index where number is present in the list else nil

#Example: def binarySearch(sorted_list, number)


#We have a mongodb collection named *useer*. Its schema is {_id, name, phone, address, age, sex}. This user collection has 100 million documents and searching the document with phone is too slow. What would you like to do to make search fast


#Implement a max heap using python class. Heap should contain an user object and it should heapify based on _id
